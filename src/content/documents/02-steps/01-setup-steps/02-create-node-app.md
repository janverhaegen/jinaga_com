title: "Create a Node Application"
---

Jinaga JS is based on [Node](https://nodejs.org).
To create a new Node application, start with an empty folder.

```bash
mkdir myapplication
cd myapplication
```

Then initialize a new Node app in that folder.

```bash
npm init
```

Answer the questions.
The defaults are good to start with.
When you are done, you will have a new file called `package.json`.
