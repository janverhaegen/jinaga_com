title: "Client-Side Steps"

Jinaga runs on both the server and the client.
On the client, it manages data for the UI framework of your choice.
We really like React.

Make sure that you have [created a Node app](../setup-steps/create-node-app/), [installed Jinaga](../setup-steps/install-jinaga/), and set up any other parts of your toolchain you prefer.
You will also need a server-side that can [serve a web page](../server-side-steps/serving-web-page/) and has a [Jinaga endpoint](../server-side-steps/jinaga-server/).
