title: "Database Steps"

The whole point of creating an application is to let users store their data.
So far you have a server that collects data from the client.
But when that server shuts down, all of the data is gone.
We want to store that data in a database.
Jinaga uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to do that.
