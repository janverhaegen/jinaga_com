title: "Server-Side Steps"
---

Jinaga works on both the client and the server.
The server is responsible for storing your user's data to permanent storage.
It serves that data up to the client, and keeps it informed when things change.

To get started building server-side components, make sure that you have [created a Node Application](../setup-steps/create-node-app/), [installed Jinaga](../setup-steps/install-jinaga/), and set up any other parts of your toolchain you prefer.
We will construct the server-side components in `src/server`.
