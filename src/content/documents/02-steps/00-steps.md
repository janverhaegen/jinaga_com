So you want to get something done?
Well, you're going to have to take it step-by-step.

Each of the steps below solves a single problem.
Skip straight to the step you need, or follow them one-by-one.
Some steps are specific to a language (TypeScript vs JavaScript), and some are just for one front-end framework (we like React).
Navigate your way through the steps that you need, and ignore the ones you don't.
